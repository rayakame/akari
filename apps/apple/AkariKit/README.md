# AkariKit

Shared Swift package with the logic and view models used by both the macOS and iOS
apps, built on the Swift bindings from `akari-ffi`.

## Building and testing

The package needs akari-ffi's XCFramework and generated Swift bindings, which aren't checked
in. Build them first (needs full Xcode), then test:

```sh
apps/apple/build-ffi.sh             # release, Apple silicon and Intel
apps/apple/build-ffi.sh --host-only # just this Mac's architecture, for local iteration
swift test --package-path apps/apple/AkariKit
```

Run the script again whenever akari-ffi changes.

## Targets

- `akari_ffiFFI`: the XCFramework (static library, C header and module map).
- `AkariFFI`: the generated `akari_ffi.swift` plus hand-written value types: typed IDs
  (`Snowflake<Marker>` with `UserId`, `GuildId`, `ChannelId`, …), the `Permissions` bits, and
  akari-core's error texts as `LocalizedError`. The generated code stays in its own target
  because it doesn't compile with MainActor as the default isolation.
- `AkariKit`: re-exports `AkariFFI`; the view models come next.

How state crosses the boundary is described in `crates/akari-ffi/README.md`.
